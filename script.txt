Hey what's going on guys and welcome to a new series of Modules in Python
today's module is the Turtle moduand we 're going to have a look at what it offers through
desiginig and building  the famous SNAKE game, and I remember the first time I have played it was on Nokia 3310 back in 2001 in my first year in the Alexandria State University.

The idea of Snake is very simple, where you - the player - move the snake in a sqaured field and eat the apples, and everytime you eat one apple the length of the snake grows, and if the snake touches itself or touches the border, then the game will be over.

the prerequisites for this game project are: 

1- Turtle module : which is a builtin Python module which means you don't have to install it, and it's used to create pictures and various shapes on a virtual canvas using turtle pen and we will see that in a minute, but the concept is very easy and actually the turtle module encourages a lot of children to start programming, because of its ease of use and the productivity they witness on the screen - and I can relate to that as in 1992 I was 9 years old and I started to program on BASIC on my ATARI 800XL, and it was the same exact thing drawing flowers and geomterical simple shapes with different colors, but got me interested in programming since then - if you want to know more about the turtle module I suggest you check out my good friend Christian Thompson's channel TokyoEdTech, he is the king of the turtle module on YouTube in my opinion and you will find a lot of very interesting videos there if you're into video games in Python.  

2- Also we'll need the Random module to generate random numbers [ and I have a full tutorial on the random module if you want to check it out ]

3- And the time module, and this simply provides time functionalities to the game.
